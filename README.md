## 🚀 Inspiration  
We wanted to empower individuals to make informed financial decisions and better understand their investment strategies. Inspired by the complexity of stock data, ever-changing market news, and the challenges of personal financial planning, we built FinHealth to centralize these insights in a user-friendly platform.

## 🤷 What it does
- **Stock Recommendations**: A main dashboard showcasing stock charts, their news, recommended action (buy, sell, or hold) and sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative).
- **AI Chatbot**: Context-aware chat that factors in selected stock data and recent news for more informed conversations.
- **Personalized Analysis**: Users can submit their information and receive tailored investment advice and recommendations.
- **Portfolio Analysis**: An AI chatbot that analyzes screenshots of a user’s portfolio to offer deeper insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Web app:** Streamlit / Python
- **Chatbot:** OpenAI API for question answering & personal recommendations
- **Sentiment Analysis:** NLTK
- **Buy/Sell/Hold Recommendation:** scikit-learn

## ⚔️ Challenges Faced  
- **Training the classification model** with good results was difficult, as we attempted various permutations of features to train on (ex: moving averages). Some permutations would give accuracies above 90% - as well as training the model on multiple stocks - but the predictions didn't make sense. At the end, we found **training one model for each stock** gave the best predictions.
- **Learning Streamlit**: Adapting to Streamlit’s unique structure and deployment model was a hurdle for our team.
- **AI Integration**: We discovered the importance of refining prompt engineering to ensure clear and context-aware recommendations.
